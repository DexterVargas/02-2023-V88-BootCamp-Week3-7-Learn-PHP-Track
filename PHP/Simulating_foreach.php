<?php 
#1. What do you think will be the output of below code? Try to guess before running it!
	/* Answer: 
	0 - 2
	1 - 4
	2 - 6
	3 - 8
	*/
	
#2. What would be the output of the following code? Try to guess before running it!
	/* Answer: 
	2
	4
	6
	8
	*/

#3. What will be the output of this? Again, guess the output before running the code.
	/* Answer: 
	A - Apple
	B - Banana
	*/

#4. How about the following code? Try to guess the output of the code before running it!
	/* Answer: 
	Apple
	Banana
	*/

#5. Let's change the echo statement. Make a guess!
	/* Answer: 
	A
	B
	*/

#6. Okay. Now let's make it more challenging. What would be the output of the following code?
	/* Answer: 
	Key is 0
	logging the value
	0 => string 'a1' (length=2)
	1 => string 'a2' (length=2)
	2 => string 'a3' (length=2)
	Key is 1
	logging the value
	0 => string 'b1' (length=2)
	1 => string 'b2' (length=2)
	2 => string 'b3' (length=2)
	Key is 2
	logging the value
	0 => string 'c1' (length=2)
	1 => string 'c2' (length=2)
	2 => string 'c3' (length=2)
	*/

#7. Now what about this? Again guess the output before running the code.
	/* Answer: 
	logging the value
	0 => string 'a1' (length=2)
	1 => string 'a2' (length=2)
	2 => string 'a3' (length=2)
	logging the value
	0 => string 'b1' (length=2)
	1 => string 'b2' (length=2)
	2 => string 'b3' (length=2)
	logging the value
	0 => string 'c1' (length=2)
	1 => string 'c2' (length=2)
	2 => string 'c3' (length=2)
	*/

#8. Okay. Now let's make it even harder. What would be the output of the following code?
	/* Answer: 
	Key is 0
	PH - Philippines
	KR - Korea
	Key is 1
	PHP - Philippine peso
	KRW - Korean won
	Key is 2
	Manila - Maynilad
	Seoul - Seorabeol
	*/

#9. At last! What about this?
	/* Answer: 
	PH - Philippines
	KR - Korea
	PHP - Philippine peso
	KRW - Korean won
	Manila - Maynilad
	Seoul - Seorabeol
	*/
