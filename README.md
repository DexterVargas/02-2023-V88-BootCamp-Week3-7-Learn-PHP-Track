### PHP Track: Week 3~7 Bootcamp Exercises

This repository contains my completed exercises for the PHP track of a web development bootcamp, covering a range of intermediate to advanced backend and full-stack topics. The exercises focus on building dynamic web applications with PHP, AJAX, and MySQL.

# Core Topics and Skills Developed
- PHP Fundamentals: The foundation of the track, focusing on core PHP concepts such as syntax, variables, data types, control structures (loops, conditionals), and functions. I gained a solid understanding of how PHP processes requests on the server-side to generate dynamic HTML content.

- AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML): I explored how to use AJAX to create more responsive and interactive web experiences. The exercises involved sending and receiving data from the server asynchronously without requiring a full page reload. This included using JavaScript to make requests and handle the server's response, enabling features like live data updates and form submissions without a page refresh.

- PHP and MySQL: A crucial part of the training involved connecting PHP applications to a MySQL database. I learned how to manage databases and tables, perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and handle form data securely. These exercises were essential for building data-driven applications.

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The bootcamp introduced OOP principles in PHP, including classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism. I applied these concepts to write more organized, reusable, and maintainable code, which is a fundamental skill for large-scale application development.

- MVC (Model-View-Controller): I gained practical experience with the MVC architectural pattern, which separates an application into three interconnected components: the Model (data and business logic), the View (user interface), and the Controller (handles user input). This pattern is key to building scalable and structured applications.

- CodeIgniter: I worked with the CodeIgniter framework, a powerful tool that simplifies web development by providing a set of libraries and conventions. This section of the bootcamp focused on using the framework to build applications more efficiently by leveraging its built-in features for routing, database interaction, and form validation.

- ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) with DataMapper: The final module covered ORM, a technique that allows developers to interact with a database using an object-oriented paradigm. Specifically, I used DataMapper to map database tables to PHP objects, which simplifies database operations and reduces the amount of SQL code needed, making the development process faster and less prone to errors.

### Summary
The PHP track provided a comprehensive overview of building full-stack web applications. I progressed from fundamental server-side scripting to advanced concepts like MVC frameworks and ORM, gaining the skills necessary to develop robust, maintainable, and data-driven web solutions.
